This is a guide to transcriptome assembly and analysis used in the Palumbi Lab at Hopkins Marine Station, Stanford University.

See the [Palumbi Lab's Simple Fool's Guide to Population Genomics](http://sfg.stanford.edu) for helpful background information. Warning: scripts referred to in the SFG manual are outdated and difficult to use. 

Refer to my [in house guide](https://github.com/bethsheets/Population-Genomics-via-RNAseq/blob/docs/guide-to-assembly-scripts.md) to follow our pipeline. This doc is currently in progress and being updated regularly.

I maintain our scripts more regularly in this [repository](https://github.com/bethsheets/palumbi_scripts).
